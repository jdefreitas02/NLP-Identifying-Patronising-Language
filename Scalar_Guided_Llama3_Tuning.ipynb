I must use F1-Score, Precision, and Recall (specifically for the positive class) to correctly evaluate performance.\n",

Given that the dataset consists of news paragraphs, these short sequences are likely scraping artifacts (e.g., headers, bylines) rather than meaningful content. They represent less than 1% of the total data. As PCL relies on subtle linguistic markers and tone, these fragments lack sufficient context to be meaningfully labeled and likely constitute noise\n",
